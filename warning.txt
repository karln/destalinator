Hi there, very quiet channel! We archive channels that have been quiet for 90 straight days via a process called Destalinator. This channel has been quiet for the last 60 days.  No content is lost when a channel is archived. If this channel is needed again, it can be unarchived by any user here. If you'd like to keep this channel active, *PLEASE START AN ON TOPIC CONVERSATION* and we'll reset the timer.
